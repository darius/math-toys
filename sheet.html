    <p>This is a toy for exploring arithmetic on complex numbers: it's
      meant to afford a direct experience with them, the way piling up
      blocks is a direct experience of the natural numbers. It's
      fancier, in offering equation solving and visualization of complex
      functions. This is still a sketchy prototype, though. These
      instructions below won't try to teach you the math, either.

    <p>Click somewhere on the canvas above (or tap, if you have a
      touchscreen), and a new point will appear, called <i>a</i>. You can drag
      that point around, and if you like you can rename it using the
      Rename button below the canvas.

    <p>Tap on this point <i>a</i> to select it, and a red selection circle
      appears around it, and where 0 and 1 were there appear a plus and a
      times sign, for adding and multiplying. Drag from the plus sign to
      <i>a</i>, and a new point appears, called <i>2a</i>. While you were
      dragging, the whole canvas slides along, because that's what adding
      a complex number does: it displaces its argument.

    <p>If you released the mouse before you brought it to an
      already-created point (like <i>a</i> or 0 or 1), then that canceled the
      addition. You can however subtract: if you slide from 0 to the
      point <i>opposite</i> <i>a</i>, then that's like adding -<i>a</i>.

    <p>Once you've created another point this way, such as 2<i>a</i>, notice
      that dragging <i>a</i> around makes 2<i>a</i> move with it. You can
      drag 2<i>a</i> instead and see <i>a</i> move.

    <p>Now to multiply: select <i>a</i> again, then this time drag from
      the times sign at 1 on the complex plane. If you drag from there
      to <i>a</i>, you'll create <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>. Try
      dragging <i>a</i> now up to the point one unit above the origin, and
      see <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> move to -1.

    <p>Create another point <i>b</i> by clicking elsewhere on the
      canvas. Add it to <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> by selecting one of them and
      dragging from 0 to the other. Now with the
      new <i>a<sup>2</sup>+b</i> still selected, click on the 'Show field'
      button below the canvas. A new, smaller canvas should appear,
      showing a view of the whole function <i>aâ†’a<sup>2</sup>+b</i> as a
      vector field: each arrow on the new canvas shows a shrunken-down
      picture of the value of <i>a<sup>2</sup>+b</i> for a
      particular <i>a</i>. Now drag <i>b</i> around and watch how the
      field changes.

    <p>(This view actually curves the arrows to approximate how the
      function changes in the neighborhood of each input point. I think I
      was getting too fancy there, but I haven't yet come back to remove
      this feature.)

    <p>Here's a kind of fun thing to do: create some more powers
      of <i>a</i>,
      say <i>a<sup>3</sup></i>, <i>a<sup>4</sup></i>, <i>a<sup>5</sup></i>.
      Drag <i>a<sup>5</sup></i> around the origin and back to 1. The
      others arrange themselves in a regular pentagon around the
      origin. Try dragging the last one around the circle again, and the
      others will change places into a star polygon. (This may be clearer
      if you drag <i>a<sup>5</sup></i> a little outside the circle so that
      it becomes a spiral.)

    <p>Division is like subtraction: drag from the multiply sign to the
      reciprocal of the target. (But the vector-field display doesn't yet
      work with division or subtraction or the constraint-solving
      introduced below.)

    <p>You can introduce constraints using the 'Pin/unpin point' and 'Merge
      points' buttons: select a point and press the Pin button. Now when
      you drag another point, the pinned one won't move. Press the Pin
      button again to unpin it.

    <p>Merging points permanently equates them. First drag the points
      you want to merge till they're close together; they acquire a blue
      halo and 'Merge points' button becomes active. Press it.

    <p>Sticking to adding and multiplying (no dividing), the functions
      you can make are called polynomials. If you play with it, you'll
      find that every nonconstant polynomial can be dragged to any
      target. This would <i>not</i> be true of 'real' numbers. Why does it
      always work? I don't know! This is called the fundamental theorem of
      algebra, and other people have proved it; I'd like to figure it out
      without peeking.
